    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made by layering sheets of wide, flat pasta with rich sauces, cheeses, and fillings,
    then baking it until bubbly and golden. Traditionally, it features layers of pasta alternated with a hearty meat ragù
    (often made from ground beef or pork cooked in tomato sauce), creamy béchamel or ricotta cheese, and a generous topping
    of mozzarella and Parmesan. The result is a comforting, flavorful casserole that balances tender pasta, savory sauce,
    and melted cheese in every bite.</p>

    <p>Beyond the traditional recipe, lasagna has countless regional and modern variations. Some versions swap the meat for
    vegetables like spinach, zucchini, or eggplant, while others use different cheeses or tomato-free sauces. In America,
    ricotta-based lasagna is especially popular, while in Italy, béchamel tends to take the lead. Whether made for a family
    dinner or a special occasion, lasagna remains one of the most beloved comfort foods in the world — hearty, satisfying,
    and steeped in culinary tradition.</p>
