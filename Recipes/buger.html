    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Burgers are a classic staple of American cuisine, consisting of a juicy, seasoned patty—usually made from ground
        beef—
        served inside a soft, toasted bun. The patty is often grilled or pan-seared to perfection, then topped with melted
        cheese,
        crisp lettuce, fresh tomato slices, onions, and condiments like ketchup, mustard, or mayonnaise. The result is a
        satisfying
        combination of smoky, savory flavors and soft, crunchy textures that make burgers one of the most popular comfort
        foods
        around the world.</p>
    
    <p>Over time, burgers have evolved far beyond their traditional form, with endless variations to suit every taste and
        diet. From turkey and veggie patties to gourmet versions featuring brioche buns, caramelized onions, and specialty
        sauces,
        there’s a burger for everyone. Whether enjoyed at a summer cookout, a fast-food joint, or a high-end restaurant,
        burgers
        remain a timeless favorite—simple, customizable, and universally loved.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb (450 g) ground beef (80/20 blend for best flavor)</li>
        <li>4 burger buns, toasted</li>
        <li>4 slices of cheese (American, cheddar, or your choice)</li>
        <li>1 tomato, sliced</li>
        <li>1 small onion, sliced</li>
        <li>4 leaves of lettuce</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>Ketchup, mustard, and mayonnaise (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Form the Patties — Divide the ground beef into four equal portions, shape into patties about ¾ inch thick, and
            season both sides with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Cook the Patties — Grill or pan-sear the patties over medium-high heat for 3–4 minutes per side, adding cheese
            during the last minute of cooking to melt.</li>
        <li>Assemble the Burgers — Place the cooked patties on the bottom buns, then add lettuce, tomato, onion, and your
            preferred condiments. Top with the other half of the bun and serve warm.</li>
